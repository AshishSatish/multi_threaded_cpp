# Multi-Threaded Dataset Processor in C++

## 📌 Overview
This project is a high-performance **C++ application** designed to efficiently process large datasets using **multi-threading**. It divides the dataset into multiple chunks, processes them in parallel using threads, and merges the results for faster computation.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Multi-threaded Processing:** Utilizes `std::thread` to execute tasks concurrently.
- ✅ **Thread Synchronization:** Uses `std::mutex` to prevent race conditions.
- ✅ **Optimized Data Handling:** Reads large datasets from a file and dynamically partitions data for processing.
- ✅ **Scalability:** Adjusts thread count based on available CPU cores for optimal performance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C++11 or later** (Standard library features)
- **Multi-threading (`std::thread`, `std::mutex`)**
- **File I/O (`fstream`)**
- **Dataset processing and optimization techniques**
